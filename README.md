# 🌍 Groundwater Extraction and Resource Analysis (India)
## 📌 Project Overview

India is one of the largest users of groundwater in the world. With rising demand for irrigation, urban growth, and industrial use, many states are facing severe groundwater stress, while others still have untapped potential.

This project analyzes groundwater recharge, extractable resources, and sector-wise extraction across 37 Indian states & union territories (UTs). The dashboard highlights critical insights such as over-exploited states, surplus regions, sectoral demand patterns, and inter-state disparities.

**⚡ Built entirely in Power BI (with Power Query and DAX), this project demonstrates my ability to:**

Clean and transform raw government data

Build interactive visualizations with slicers, filters, and dynamic tooltips

Communicate data insights in a policy-relevant and easy-to-understand way

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

**🔹 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

* Total Recharge vs Extractable Resource vs Extraction

* Stage of Extraction (%) 

**🔹 Visualizations**

* Sector-wise Stacked Bar Chart → Shows irrigation, industrial, and domestic extraction

* Top 5 & Bottom 5 States (Stage of Extraction) → Overexploited vs surplus regions

* Category Analysis (Safe / Semi-Critical / Critical / Overexploited) → Classification of states

* Dynamic Tooltips → Hovering shows policy-style insights (e.g., “Punjab over-extracts by 10.95 BCM → 20,00,000 hectares irrigation lost”)

**🔹 Key Insights (Policy Lens)**

* 6 states are overexploited → urgent demand management needed

* Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana under extreme stress (>130%)

* North-Eastern states show surplus → opportunity to balance regional use

* Irrigation dominates (~85–90% of extraction)

* Urban & industrial demand is rising → efficiency crucial

* Large inter-state disparity → requires region-specific water policies

## 🗂️ Data Source

The dataset was obtained from the Open Government Data Platform, India (data.gov.in).
Population data was also combined for per-capita analysis (though not included in final dashboard).

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

Power BI: Interactive dashboards, slicers, tooltips

Power Query: Data cleaning & transformation

DAX (Basic): Custom measures (Stage of Extraction %, Top/Bottom 5 states, dynamic tooltip text)

Excel: Used initially for exploring and cleaning raw data

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

This project reflects my experience of working with groundwater and irrigation data during my 4 years as a civil engineer in India. By combining that background with my current learning in Power BI, I demonstrate how I can transform real-world datasets into clear visual stories that support policy and decision-making.

## 🚀 Next Steps

Extend analysis with rainfall & river basin data for holistic water planning

Add time-series trends (multi-year extraction data)

Deploy interactive dashboard online (Power BI Service or embedded app)

## 👋 About Me

With 4 years of experience as a civil engineer working on irrigation and groundwater projects, I am now upskilling in Power BI, SQL, and Python to transition into data analytics.

This project demonstrates how I can use my domain experience and new technical skills to analyze real-world data and present it in a meaningful way.
